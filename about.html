      <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Max grew up here in Baltimore and headed up to Massachusetts to attend Hampshire College, completing a bachelor’s degree in Stream Ecology.  Like many young people that graduated in 2011, the first job he found was as a line cook…the first turn down the road that eventually led to “Pie Time.” </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Max’s love for coffee and pie turned into a plan to open a coffee shop serving sweet and savory pies. He decided to start smaller and more efficiently with Pie Time--selling sweet and savory pies along with specialty coffee at area farmers markets. While working a line cooking job part time, Max started doing smaller weekday farmers markets during the summer of 2015 and renting kitchen space from a soul food take out restaurant.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Pie Time was admitted to the Baltimore Farmers Market and Bazaar for the 2016 season--this allowed Max to grow the business at B-more kitchen, Baltimore's first incubator kitchen.  In the 2017 market season, Pie time partnered with Dear Globe coffee roasters and built the mobile espresso cart for coffee service at farmers markets. In 2019, the Espresso Cart 2.0 was built by Nick Ireys Metal Designs and the woodwork finished by Mark Supik Wood Turning Co.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In October 2018, Max was able to acquire 3101 E Baltimore Street in Patterson Park, SE Baltimore.  After a rough construction process filled with groundwater, crumbling roofs, site abandonment, and a crook of a contractor-Pie Time finally opened October 2020!</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Seasonal and fresh local fruit are the centerpieces of the sweet pies.  Pie Time Pies should taste like they were stolen from your grandmothers pantry!  Max’s background as a cook makes the savory pies more progressive, with many of the recipes founded in classic technique.</p>
